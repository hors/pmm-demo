#
# !include this file into your my.cnf (or any of *.cnf files in /etc/my.cnf.d)
# and it will enable data at rest encryption. This is a simple way to
# ensure that everything that can be encrypted will be and your
# data will not leak unencrypted.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! On MariaDB upgrades it might be replaced with a
# newer version and your edits will be lost. Instead, add your edits
# to the .cnf file after the !include directive.
#
# NOTE that you also need to install an encryption plugin for the encryption
# to work. See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/data-at-rest-encryption/#encryption-key-management
